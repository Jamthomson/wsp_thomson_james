	<h1>Project Analysis: Exotic Experience in Orlando Site</h1>
		
		<div id="info">

	<h3>Analysis performed by: James Thomson</h3>
	<h3>Client: Exotic Experience in Orlando (EEO): www.exoticexperence.net</h3>
	<h3>Project: Redesign of current website.</h3>
	<h3>Designer/Developer: James Thomson</h3>
		
		</div> 

	<h2>Site Intent:</h2>

		<p>The intent of Exotic Experience in Orlando is to provide customers, young and old with the ability to get up close and personal with exotic animals from around the world. They do this by hosting events at their facility in Orlando Florida and also transporting the animals to clients events in and around the Orlando area. The company seeks to attract middle and high income families with children to their site and entice them to book a party or visit their facility. The consumers goals are to have an experience with these animals and make memories that will last a life time.</p> 
		<p>I could not find any indication as to whether or not the consumers goals were being met. I could find no comments or satisfaction ratings on the business in my research. The website is definitely not meeting the goals of the business. The website is very amateurish and upon viewing the code is done entirely with html. It does not provide escape hatches for the user to return to the home page and only provides phone, email and a Facebook link for customers to contact them.  The photo galleries, while nice, are very confusing with pictures of different sizes haphazardly arranged over three pages.</p>
		<p>The redesigned site will be built using proper HTML5 markup and CSS. It will meet W3C standards and be responsive enabling it to be viewed on numerous devices including mobile phones. The new site will be more professional, clean and aesthetically pleasing. We will clean up the task flow and remove unnecessary content and reduce the redundancies in the site.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
	<h3>Overview:</h3>

		<p>After extensive searches on the INTERNET I was unable to find a business in the Orlando area that offered the same services that EEO offers. The best I could find were pet stores that sell reptiles. This means that with a good web presence, a professional website, and proper SEO EEO could lead the market in this area in the Orlando area. I have included the below three companies as an analysis simply because they sell reptiles and Blazin Reptiles does do shows with their animals, but they are located in Jacksonville, FL.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.blazinreptiles.net/">Blazin Reptiles</a></h3>

		<p>Blazin Reptiles is an exotic pet store located in Jacksonville, Fl. Their website is very clean, simple and professional. They not only sell exotic pets but they also do shows for birthday parties and this is why I chose them. The website is very colorful and would appeal to the children that these birthday parties would be for. The site is easy to navigate and learn making it more likely that a visitor would return for a repeat visit. One thing that I did notice about this site is that the logo is not an escape hatch to return to the home page like users are used to on most sites. The site received 4.5 stars on Yelp with two reviews, 2.5 stars on Mojo with 6 votes and 50% mojo and 26 google reviews with an overall score of 5.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.petco.com/petco_page_pc_shoppinghome.aspx?cm_mmc=GOOGLEOFF-_-Brand-Offline|Exact-Search-Computers|USA-_-Brand%20Test%20|%20Exact-_-petco-Exact">PetCo</a></h3>

		<p>PetCo is a major chain pet store located in the Orlando area. Again this store really does not have much in common with EAEO except they have reptiles and other exotic pets. PetCo's website is very professional, easy to navigate and all well presented. The site is large with a lot of content but escape hatches are located on each page making it easy to return to the home page. PetCo's Alexa rankings are as follows:</p>
	<h4>Alexa Rankings:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Traffic Rank- 5,247</li>
			<li>Ranking in U.S.- 988</li>
			<li>Reputation- 6,165 sites linking in.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>PetSmart is another chain pet store that sells reptiles and exotic pets. They do not have anything in common with EAEO but I chose them for their streamlined website and their successful web presence.</p>
	<h4>Alexa Rankings:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Traffic Rank- 4,994</li>
			<li>Rank in U.S.- 990</li>

	<h2>Targeted Audience:</h2>

		<p>The Jones family is a family of four who is planning a birthday party for their 6 y/o son who, like most 6 y/o, is very into exotic animals. They have an average yearly income of $65,000.00, own their own home and have two cars. Since their son is the oldest child they are hoping that their daughter, once she attends the son's party, will want to have EAEO at her party. They chose EEO because of their reputation, ease of booking the party and reasonable pricing. Mrs. Jones is a stay at home mom and spends a lot of time on the Internet looking for bargains and cutting coupons to help save the family money. She is very net savvy and found EAEO very easily.</p>

		<p>Brenda Miller is a 25 y/o single mother of one who wants to do something special for her 7 y/o daughters birthday. She has an average yearly income of $45,000.00, rents in an apartment complex and drives a late model car. Her biggest priority is her daughter and she spoils her as much as her limited income allows. Her daughters favorite animal is a lemur and all she talks about is petting one someday. While searching the web for pictures of lemur's for her daughter the search engine displayed the EEO website causing Brenda to click on the link and book her daughters party.</p>
